If you are a developer or just a modder you can use these procedures:

	round_trunks.trunks_overrider(nodestring)
	round_trunks.leaves_overrider(nodestring)

"nodestring" is, e.g. "modname:trunk_node" or "modname:leaves_node"

The trunks overrider is to apply the cylindrical shape.
The leaves overrider is to apply the X-shaped drawtype.
