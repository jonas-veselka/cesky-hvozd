minetest mod Real Torch
=======================

Made torchs more realistic way behaviour.

Information
-----------

This mod is named `real_torch`, changes torches so that they have a life
of 20-30 minutes which is configurable using the `torch_min_duration`
and `torch_max_duration` settings. It also can be relight using coals, flint or steel, and can be affected by water.

- 2x coal lumps can be crafted into 12x coal powder
- coal powder and an unlit torch can be crafted into a lit torch again
- punching an unlit torch with coal powder relights it
- punching an unlit torch with flint & steel relights it
- punching an unlit torch with gunpowder explodes and relights it
- never punch a lit torch with gunpowder, ow!
- water near torches make them drop as unlit torches
- coal powder can also be used for fuel or crafted into black dye
