Giftbox2 Mod
By Leslie E. Krause and Wuzzy

Giftbox2 provides an assortment of presents for special occasions.
Players can craft gift boxes and place them anywhere, including
protected areas and designate them to an optional receiver.
The receiver can dig the gift box and gets a random item.

Note the placer cannot receive their own gift, if they dig the gift
box, they will get the gift box back, not its random item.

Server operators can configure the list of random drops in config.lua.

This is a fork of the [giftbox] mod.
